  Proposed design for user impersonation by administrators on the Rubin
  Science Platform.

# Abstract, if available
abstract: >-
  In normal operation, the Rubin Science Platform will authenticate a user via
  an external identity provider and ensure that all actions by that user are
  associated with that identity. However, there are cases, such as debugging
  user problems or dealing with certain types of security issues, where it is
  invaluable for an administrator to be able to access the Science Platform as
  if they were another user. They can then see exactly what that user would
  see and make changes as the user to fix problems. This tech note proposes a
  design for implementing user impersonation in Gafaelfawr, the authentication
  system for the Science Platform.
